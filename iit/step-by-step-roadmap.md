## **5️⃣ Coaching Guidance (Pune)**

* FIITJEE, Aakash, Allen (Foundational / IIT-JEE early programs)
* Small batch or online + weekend classes work well
* For Class 6–8: Focus on **concept clarity**, not JEE-level intensity

---

## **6️⃣ Key Tips for Parents**

* Encourage curiosity and problem-solving
* Avoid comparing marks with others
* Ensure **1–2 hours fun/physical activity daily**
* Celebrate **effort, not only results**
* Keep a long-term view: JEE success = 6–8 year journey
