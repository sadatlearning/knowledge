## To create a **clear, realistic, and stress-free IIT preparation plan** for your child, I need just a **few details** from you.

Please reply with the following (you can answer in short):

1️⃣ **Child’s current class** (example: Class 6, 8, 9, 11, etc.)
2️⃣ **Strength level** (choose one):

* Strong in Math & Science
* Average
* Needs support
  3️⃣ **Learning style preference**:
* School + Coaching
* Online learning
* Self-study with guidance
  4️⃣ **Daily study time available** (outside school):
  1–2 hrs / 2–3 hrs / 3+ hrs
  5️⃣ **City / Country** (optional – helps with coaching guidance)

Once you share this, I will give you:

* 📌 **Year-by-year roadmap**
* 📌 **Weekly study structure**
* 📌 **Exact subject focus per class**
* 📌 **Books & resources**
* 📌 **Parent do’s & don’ts**

This will be a **balanced plan**, not pressure-based.
Waiting for your details 🌱
