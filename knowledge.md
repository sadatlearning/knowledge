1. **Mathematics and Physics**

   * Physics uses mathematical equations to describe motion, energy, and forces.
   * Without math, physics loses its precision; without physics, math loses some practical meaning.

2. **Biology and Chemistry**

   * Biological processes (like metabolism) depend on chemical reactions.
   * Chemistry explains *how* life functions at the molecular level.

3. **Computer Science and Logic**

   * Algorithms are based on logical reasoning.
   * Logic gives structure to problem-solving in programming.

4. **History and Politics**

   * To understand modern political systems, we must understand their historical roots.

### 🧠 Why It’s Important

1. **Deeper Understanding:** You see the “why” behind things, not just the “how.”
2. **Creativity:** New ideas often come from connecting fields (e.g., bioinformatics = biology + computer science).
3. **Critical Thinking:** Recognizing connections helps you reason across disciplines.
4. **Holistic Learning:** You build a complete worldview rather than fragmented bits of knowledge.

### 🌐 Simple Analogy

Think of knowledge like a **web** or **network** — each node (a fact or idea) connects to others through meaningful links.
Breaking one link may affect the understanding of many others.
