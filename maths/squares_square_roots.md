## 1️⃣ Square of a Number

The **square** of a number ( x ) is the number multiplied by itself:

x^2=x×x

It is called a *square* because geometrically it represents the **area of a square** whose side length is ( x ).

### Examples:

* ( 3^2 = 3 \times 3 = 9 )
* ( (-4)^2 = (-4) \times (-4) = 16 )
* ( 0^2 = 0 )

### Important Properties:

* The square of any **positive number** is positive.
* The square of any **negative number** is also positive.
* The square of **zero** is zero.
* Therefore, **the square of any real number is never negative**.

## 2️⃣ Square Roots

The **square root** of a number is the number that, when squared, gives the original number.

If:

[
x^2 = a
]

Then:

[
x = \pm \sqrt{a}
]

### Examples:

* ( \sqrt{9} = 3 )
  (because ( 3^2 = 9 ))

But technically:

* The equation ( x^2 = 9 ) has **two solutions**:
  [
  x = +3 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -3
  ]

⚠️ Important:

* The symbol ( \sqrt{9} ) usually means the **principal (positive) square root**, which is **3**.
* Negative numbers do not have real square roots.

  * Example: ( \sqrt{-4} ) is not a real number.
  * In complex numbers, ( \sqrt{-4} = 2i ).

## 3️⃣ Powers (Exponents)

A **power** represents repeated multiplication.

[
x^n = x \times x \times x \dots (n \text{ times})
]

Where:

* ( x ) is the **base**
* ( n ) is the **exponent**

### Examples:

* ( 2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8 )
* ( 5^1 = 5 )
* ( 7^0 = 1 ) (for any nonzero number)

## 4️⃣ Special Power Rules

### ✔️ Zero Exponent Rule

[
x^0 = 1 \quad (x \neq 0)
]

### ✔️ Negative Exponent Rule

[
x^{-n} = \frac{1}{x^n}
]

Example:
[
2^{-3} = \frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}
]

### ✔️ Power of a Power

[
(x^a)^b = x^{a \times b}
]

Example:
[
(2^3)^2 = 2^6 = 64
]

## 5️⃣ Conceptual Understanding

* **Square** → Area idea (geometry).
* **Square root** → Undoing a square.
* **Power** → Repeated multiplication.
* Squaring makes numbers non-negative.
* Square roots reverse squaring (but introduce ± when solving equations).
